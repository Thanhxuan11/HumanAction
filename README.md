Summary:
This project utilizes a application built with PyQt5 to automatically classify human actions within video recordings. Users can upload a video file, and the application leverages machine learning to predict the specific action being performed with high accuracy.
Skills:
Python Programming
  Flask
  OpenCV (or similar computer vision library)
  Machine Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks likely)
  Video Processing
Benefits:
  Automates human action classification in videos with high accuracy.
  User-friendly web interface allows for easy interaction and analysis.
  Potential to expand and classify a wider range of human actions.
Applications:
  Video Surveillance: Enhance security systems by automatically identifying actions.
  Sports Analysis: Assist coaches and athletes in analyzing movements.
  Human-Computer Interaction: Develop interactive applications that respond to human actions.
  Video Indexing and Search: Improve video organization and retrieval based on actions.
